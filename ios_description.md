## Version 2.0

Digitari is the platform that transforms social media into a game!
How does it work?  

&#8291;1. Earn rewards by interacting with posts, people, and communities you love.  
&#8291;2. Use your rewards to upgrade your profile and reach more people.  
&#8291;3. Repeat :)

Pretty easy, right?  But don't worry -- once you've mastered the basics, there are
all sorts of extra features and goodies for you to unlock and discover.

Like other popular platforms, Digitari lets you express your true self
and engage with other amazing people and communities.

However, by transforming social media into a decentralized game, Digitari
has truly leveled-up the internet.

How?

■ No Ads!  
That's right, DIGITARI DOESN'T HAVE ADS! Instead of ads, Digitari
makes money by selling in-game bonuses.  That means Digitari's business model
focuses on helping users win instead of force-feeding you ads for 
products you don't want.

■ No Algorithm!  
That's right, DIGITARI DOESN'T HAVE AN ALGORITHM! Digitari creates
your feed using its free-market-based game, not an addictive and 
destabilizing Algorithm. Social Dilemma? More like the Social Solution :)

■ Wanna get famous?  
As you progress in Digitari, you'll be able to reach more and more people.
So instead of chasing an Algorithm and praying for virality, if you want to
get famous/build a following, just focus on creating good content and 
dominating the game.

■ Bye-bye toxicity!  
Unlike other platforms, Digitari's game mechanics organically reward
healthy conversation and punish toxic speech.  That means it's 
much easier to build a following if you're respectful and open-minded, 
and significantly more difficult if you're a troll sowing discord.

■ YOU are rewarded for YOUR attention!  
Your attention is extremely valuable.  Other platforms basically sell
your attention to companies through ads, leaving you with nothing.  On 
Digitari, you earn rewards for your attention that you can use to reach
more people or support your favorite creators.

## Version 1.0

Digitari is the platform that transforms social media into a game!
How do you win? By genuinely being yourself and finding people
who care.  On Digitari, you create posts that share your interests
with other users and communities, and you interact
with other people in genuine, healthy conversations.

Digitari's gamified features not only make Digitari the most fun and
interactive social platform, but they put YOU in control,
not a destabilizing and addictive Algorithm.

Here are the Digitari features that change everything:

▶ DIGICOIN!  
Digicoin is Digitari's in-game currency. Use digicoin to send your 
posts to other users' feeds.  Want 10,000 people to see your latest
meme? No problem; that'll be 100,000 digicoin.

Earn digicoin by viewing posts, receiving 
likes and responses, and completing Digitari challenges!
It feels great to collect the digicoin you've earned :) 
<br></br>

▶ CONVOS!  
Comment sections suck.  They're where decent people become horrifying 
monsters. Digitari replaces comments with convos!

A convo is a mini text conversation between you and a post creator about
their post.  It's like halfway between a comments section and a DM.

Convos only become widely visible to the platform after the post creator
responds.  So if you want your responses to show up, you have to be nice!
<br></br>

▶ TIERS!  
Your Digitari tier is an emoji that shows everyone whether you're
nice or whether you're a troll. You improve your tier by having 
good convos, and you harm your tier by having bad ones.

Digitari rewards users with higher tiers, so if you wanna get big, 
you gotta be nice!

Here are a couple more ways Digitari is changing the internet:

■ No Ads!  
That's right, DIGITARI DOESN'T HAVE ADS! How? Instead of ads, Digitari
makes money by selling digicoin.  That means Digitari's business model 
focuses on helping users share their message with people who want 
to hear it, not by force-feeding you ads for products you don't want.  

■ No Algorithm!  
That's right, DIGITARI DOESN'T HAVE AN ALGORITHM! How? Part of Digitari's
game is that users "pay" digicoin to put their posts in your feed.
That means Digitari doesn't need to use an Algorithm to create your feed!
You only receive posts from users and communities you follow, so your
feed is always relevant to your interests.

■ Total transparency!  
Unlike other platforms, creators have TOTAL CONTROL
over how many people receive their content.  Posting on Digitari
costs 10 digicoin per person who receives your post, so (for example) 
if you want to reach 500 people, you'll need 5,000 digicoin.
It's as easy as that.

■ Bye-bye internet toxicity!  
On other platforms, there are almost no consequences for slandering,
trashing, and heaping insults on other users' posts.  On Digitari, 
people interact in convos that aren't widely visible until both people 
respond.  So even if you disagree with or don't like another user,
you have to be civil for your response to show up.  This system creates
a culture of beneficial communication, rather than hateful anarchy.

■ YOU are rewarded for YOUR attention!  
Your attention is extremely valuable.  Other platforms basically sell
your attention to companies through ads, leaving you with nothing.  On
Digitari, YOU earn digicoin by viewing posts, which YOU can then use to 
create bigger posts or support your favorite creators.  That means YOU
capture the value of your attention, not some gigantic company 
you don't care about.
